## Bio
I am a Computer Science PhD student at The University of Maryland, fortunately advised by Prof. [Aravind Srinivasan](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/). My research interests include randomized algorithms, machine learning, and fairness. I am also proud to be a 2022 [Data Science for Social Good Fellow](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) in affiliation with Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Mathematics B.S. from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.
