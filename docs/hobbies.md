I love lifting weights and have a 1000 lb squat-bench-deadlift total. I also enjoy hiking, climbing, running and swimming.

During one of my last days visiting Hawaii, [Mauna Loa erupted for the first time since 1984](https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/nature/ml2022.htm).

I also enjoy volunteering and care deeply about making STEM accessible! Places I have volunteered at include:
BlairHacks 2022 (Python Workshop Host), Baltimore Polytechnic Institure,
Lakeland Elementary and Middle School, George B. Thomas Learning Academy
