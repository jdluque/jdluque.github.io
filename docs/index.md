I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Aravind Srinivasan at the University of Maryland in College Park where I student Computer Science and do research on randomized algorithms, machine learning, and fairness. I am also happy to be a Data Science for Social Good Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Mathematics B.S. from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.
